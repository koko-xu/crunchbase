In partnership with leading international corporations, CORE POWER aims to deliver durable zero-emission energy for floating industrial production and deep-sea shipping. Advanced atomic technologies are set to create the first sustainable zero-emission energy system for ocean transportation and represents an economic opportunity worth $27 billion by 2040. It can form the start of a ‘second atomic era’, where climate change is the main driver of powerful, inexpensive, and safe new energy solutions.  Over the next few decades as many as 60,000 ships must transition from combustion of fossil fuels to zero-emission propulsion. The UN’s maritime agency IMO has mandated with unanimous approval from 174 countries that shipping must reduce emissions by 50% of the 2008 total, before 2050. This means an actual emission reduction of almost 90%, by 2050. The m-MSR can achieve that goal alone, by producing green sustainable fuels for the smaller ships and powering the largest ships. Zero emissions come as standard. Advanced atomic technologies are like atomic battery packs. Small, with few moving parts, it can be a third cheaper to run than a large fossil fuelled engine. It massively reduces waste, and is fuelled-for-life, avoiding proliferation of spent fuel. Advanced atomic technologies can be inherently walk-away safe. Atomic reactors produce heat. Therefore, the coolant is the key to safety. This is the very definition of passive walk-away safety which will create a positive public opinion.

The proof of concept went through a certified third party data center pre-commissioning process and was validated by the engineering firms – Jacobs Engineering and Critical Engineering Group.  Since it is five times more efficient to cool using water versus moving air, Nautilus’ patented cooling technology leverages the natural water that the barge safely rests on and allows the company to offer customers a high-density computing data center environment. Specifically, the waterborne data center can be configured and operated with up to 800 server racks deployed in less than six months anywhere around the world.

Central to the business’ investment plans is an equity commitment of $600m led by Warburg Pincus, the global private equity house. They bring more than 50 years’ experience in growth investment to Trident, having supported over 800 companies with more than $60bn of equity. The team at Trident Energy is one of the industry’s most experienced in the science of operating and redeveloping mid-life oil and gas assets. It considers fields that are no longer central to their owners’ strategic goals but can still deliver growth by applying fresh thinking, specialist mid-life experience and technology. With forensic attention to detail, the teams re-interpret subsurface data and leverage the existing infrastructure to redevelop and re-energise fields. Activities range from well-work and drilling to near-field exploration. Trident Energy’s vision is to build a geographically diversified portfolio of sizable and producing mid-life oil and gas assets located onshore and offshore, redeveloping and operating them to world-class standards. The group is primarily focused on Africa and Latin America but is open to opportunities in Europe and Asia.  The first acquired assets were successfully taken over from Hess Corporation in 2017. The Okume and Ceiba fields are located in both shallow and deep water in the Rio Muni basin of Equatorial Guinea. At the time of the takeover, the asset was producing 42,000 barrels of oil per day. In just a matter of months, Trident Energy had already increased output by 24% and is continuing to enhance production. The group’s plan in Equatorial Guinea not only delivered initial gains but also outlines years of future cost-effective production increases. To extend the life of fields, the existing infrastructures are leveraged. Complex operating challenges are managed to enable redevelopment and exploration. The focus is then on increasing production and creating new reserves. The Trident Energy team draws on years of field experience and best-in-class reservoir management skills to deliver its plans and create value for all its stakeholders.

The material uses the sunlight and the skyline for cooling and is most effective when it is very hot and the sun is strongest. The material can be used as a coating for cooling cars, buildings, containers, apparels, airplanes, etc., and is expected to bring tremendous savings in cooling and air-conditioning expenses and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The SolCold material is no thicker than a business card. How does it work? Once applied to a surface of an object, the sun’s radiation triggers a reaction in our material. This reaction converts the heat accumulated in the object into radiation. This radiation is then emitted in both a process called ‘anti-Stokes fluorescence’ and excess radiative emission, thus providing the cooling effect.  SolCold’s material functions as if it were a thin layer of ice that gets thicker and cooler as the sun gets stronger.","Advanced Materials, Energy Efficiency, Manufacturing, Wellness",SolCold is a nanotechnology company that specializes in the fields of nano-particles and physics.,2016-01-15,day,https://solcold.com/

It is costly, infrequent, and only addresses those lines that are within reach. In fact, it is estimated that 40% of the world’s pipelines are unpiggable. The vulnerabilities between inspections, which are typically years apart, or the inability to conduct inspections at all, puts the world’s aging pipeline infrastructure at risk. In order to address these issues, we have focused on changing the economics, the technology, and the workflow associated with inline inspection. We have introduced the industry’s first self-serve inspection model that eliminates significant engineering and downtime costs. We have developed miniature, multi sensor Pipers® technology that freely flows within any and all active pipelines, regardless of location, condition, material or configuration. This technology is capable of inspecting pipelines as small as 2 inches in diameter, and surveying for leaks, geometric defects, magnetic anomalies, and deposits in a single run. Further, we have reduced the cost of inline inspection by a factor of 10, making it possible for integrity programs to be more present, more often, across all of their assets. Finally, such accessible technology has given us the opportunity to work with a complete range of clients – large and small, private and public – resulting in rich datasets libraries that offer unprecedented contextual analysis and continuous advancement of our data analytics capabilities. Our approach provides clients with uninterrupted access to up-to-date condition-critical data, allowing them to optimize planning, decision-making, and actions.","CleanTech, Information Technology, Oil and Gas, Security",INGU offers an operating system for pipeline integrity and performance.,2014-07-23,day,http://www.ingu.com/
