President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, partially in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite the previous year. NASA grew out of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA), which had been researching flight technology for more than 40 years. President John F. Kennedy focused NASA and the nation on sending astronauts to the moon by the end of the 1960s. Through the Mercury and Gemini projects, NASA developed the technology and skills it needed for the journey. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first of 12 men to walk on the moon, meeting Kennedy's challenge. Meanwhile, NASA was continuing the aeronautics research pioneered by NACA. It also conducted purely scientific research and worked on developing applications for space technology, combining both pursuits in developing the first weather and communications satellites. After Apollo, NASA focused on creating a reusable ship to provide regular access to space: the space shuttle. First launched in 1981, the space shuttle flew more than 130 successful flights before retiring in 2011. In 2000, the United States and Russia established permanent human presence in space aboard the International Space Station, a multinational project representing the work of 16 nations. NASA also has continued its scientific research. In 1997, Mars Pathfinder became the first in a fleet of spacecraft that will explore Mars in the next decade, as we try to determine if life ever existed there. The Terra and Aqua satellites are flagships of a different fleet, this one in Earth orbit, designed to help us understand how our home world is changing. NASA's aeronautics teams are focused on improved aircraft travel that is safer and cleaner.

AeroMobil adopts an iterative approach to the development of personal air transportation in line with technology readiness, legislation and market acceptance. We believe the future offers unbounded opportunity for air mobility at scale but requires a pragmatic and considered approach to ensure technology and solutions implemented are safe, reliable and effective through partnership and collaboration with regulators, governments and cities to realise the benefits of all.  The first flying car from AeroMobil provides increased flexibility and versatility for the customer as it combines the best of automotive and aerospace technology into one vehicle while respecting the limits of current technology and the regulatory environment. It is the first step in our journey towards air Mobility-as-a-service (aMaaS) which will make personal transportation vastly more efficient and environmentally friendly by allowing significantly faster door-to-door travel over short and medium distances, and in areas with limited road or public transport infrastructure.","Aerospace, Automotive, Manufacturing","AeroMobil is an advanced engineering company developing a flying car, combining a sports car and a light aircraft in a single vehicle.",2010-01-01,year,http://aeromobil.com/

The Graflight V-8’s eight-cylinder, 4-stroke piston engine takes full advantage of the extensive research and development that has elevated automotive diesel engines to the highest standards, incorporating them into an engine designed specifically for general aviation.  It offers incredible advancements in reliability, safety and durability by taking a high-tech approach to the problems commonly found in competitors’ engines and eliminating them through a combination of extremely rugged yet lightweight materials and by employing the most advanced proven automotive techniques for monitoring and controlling engine performance. The Graflight V-8 is unlike anything that has ever been put inside a general aviation airplane and the results can be seen in virtually every aspect of its performance and design. Though it is of comparable weight and size, the Graflight V-8 has shown up to 40 percent fuel savings when matched against comparable turbine engines.  The engine increases range by up to 50 percent or payload by up to 40 percent compared to Avgas-powered aircraft. When compared with other aviation diesels, it is still 15 percent more fuel efficient because unlike those engines, it was built specifically to meet the requirements of flight.  It is also the cleanest and greenest engine ever manufactured for the GA market, cutting CO2 emissions by 30 percent over comparable Avgas engines and by 17 percent over competing diesel engines. In fact, if this engine could be installed in every car in America, it would cut fuel consumption across the board by 30 percent – just imagine!","Aerospace, Innovation Management","Engineered Propulsion Systems was formed in 2006 to develop, manufacture and market a revolutionary new General Aviation diesel engine.",2006-01-01,year,http://eps.aero/

The GEMS instrument suite gathers global weather data 30 times faster than current, aging satellite platforms, enabling us to improve many aspects of weather response. Our system can be built and deployed globally at a fraction of the cost of existing government (NASA/NOAA/DOD) systems. This opens the door for the first commercially viable global weather data company based on real observation, not rework of NOAA data sets.   The commercial weather data, market as determined by NOAA, is over $9 billion and is based on the reuse and rework of the same data that is available to everyone. Our focus markets are agriculture, risk mitigation, transportation, and governments. We offer our clients a unique premium and proprietary data set that will give them a market advantage.

Our business strategy relies on three core components (launch services, cubesat hardware and software) which allow us to provide a true turnkey, end-to-end space utilization solution. Realization of our vision relies on successful development of the Helios cubesat-class launch vehicle. The Helios nanolaunch system is a three-stage vertical launch vehicle with liquid propulsion in the first two stages and a solid propellant third stage. The design utilizes common propellants in the first two stages and a common engine design with nozzles optimized for altitude in a “plug cluster” aerospike configuration. Phoenix utilizes a unique hydrogen peroxide-based hypergolic propellant that eliminates the need for a separate ignition system but also is non-toxic, non-carcinogenic and the exhaust products are environmentally-friendly. This propellant family was fully developed and hot-fire qualified by Aphelion Orbitals, Inc. in 2018. We further matured the technology into Aphelion Aerospace's proprietary propellant mixture. The first stage is designed to be reusable using boostback, powered descent and vertical landing. Helios will be completely mobile and not rely on any fixed infrastructure, launch pad or processing facilities. The vehicle will be able to remain fully fueled for hours to days before launch and launch on short notice (2-3 days) after arrival at the launch site. Our launch service provides a number of key competencies: dedicated launch, custom orbital insertion, low cost, and a very short lead time. We target the following use customer types: * Commercial customers desiring rapid, guaranteed launch * Clients requiring a method of deployment and maintaining large nanosatellite constellations for communications, resource identification, and monitoring * Missions demanding specific orbits inaccessible through rideshare * Time-sensitive missions which require quick turnaround to launch * Spacecraft that need to be powered on and/or monitored real-time before deployment * Clients desiring to launch spacecraft with irregular volume and mass envelopes Aphelion Aerospace pursues an innovative launch service business model: * Our launch services are sold in a manner similar to airline ticketing * Regularly scheduled launches are provided to defined orbital inclinations * 30 days from cubesat acceptance to launch * “Gas and go” on-demand capability for dedicated launches on short notice * Full up-front price disclosure and guaranteed","Aerospace, Space Travel",Nanosatellite launch services and hardware components,2019-03-23,day,http://www.aphelionaerospace.com

It was fifty years ago, 1964, that U.S. Air Force Generals Curtis LeMay and Paul Tibbets, with U.S. Army Air Corpsman Bruce Sundlun, partnered to give birth to NetJets’ forerunner, Executive Jet Aviation, one of the world’s first aircraft management businesses. With retired Air Force Brigadier General Dick Lassiter serving as president and chairman of the board – not to mention founding partners such as entertainers James Stewart and Arthur Godfrey – They were in quite capable hands right from the start. And They’ve been pioneers ever since. In 1984, when Richard Santulli purchased EJA and created the NetJets program – and with it, the concept of fractional ownership – They truly cemented Their place in the record books. In the following years, They grew steadily and constantly looked for new ways to ensure They provided the best safety and service for Their Owners: new aircraft, new facilities, new global programs. In 1995, Warren Buffett joined NetJets as a customer; by 1998, he was so impressed with the operation that he bought the company, adding it to the Berkshire Hathaway empire. From then on, with Berkshire’s backing, NetJets has had unmatched resources to invest in whatever it takes to always be the best and safest player in the industry. Today, NetJets continues to uniquely and expertly fill a crucial need – helping Their Owners save time in order to take care of what’s most important in their lives. And as They nurture a nascent operation in China, add state-of-the-art Signature Series™ aircraft worldwide, and take any and all steps to provide the most seamless and enjoyable travel experience possible, you can bet that They will continue to live up to Their promise.","Aerospace, In-Flight Entertainment, Privacy",NetJets is the worldwide leader in private aviation and provides the safest and most secure private aviation solutions.,1964-01-01,year,https://www.netjets.com/
