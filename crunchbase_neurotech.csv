Together with commonly present neuropathic pain, and lost limb function (nerve injuries), they have no perception or control of the force required to hold or pick up objects and cannot feel their shape or consistency (when using prostheses). A century after the first prosthesis, electrodes, electronics and surgical expertise can be merged into the life-changing solution. Our venture is a synergistic effort converging expertise from microtechnologies, algorithms, electronics and clinical experimentation. We are an EPFL-based startup, founded by Francesco Petrini, Stanisa Raspopovic, and Silvestro Micera. Our mission is to re-enable upper, lower-limb amputees and nerve-damaged persons by: Restoring their complete sensory-motor functionality. Diminishing phantom limb pain. Enabling them to feel the artificial limb as part of their own body. From a market viewpoint, the nerve-injured persons do not have effective ways for function restoration, so we are proposing a novel tech and therefore generating a new market. As for amputees, the prosthetic limbs are getting more sophisticated but lack sensory feedback. We are constructing the game-changing functional improvement of the technology that will become the essential feature of the next-generation of prosthesis. Amputees and peripheral nerve damaged persons are in constant increase, mainly due to diabetes, car accidents, work injuries and wars. Among the most disabling consequences of these is the interruption of sensations flow from extremities to the brain.  The absence of feedback and the perception of prosthesis as a foreign body are the primary reason for refusal to use prosthesis. Amputees cannot feel the shape or material of objects they are holding and have no perception of the force required to hold or pick up objects. Nerve-injured persons often have completely functionally unusable limbs. In 50-80% of cases, amputees and nerve-injured experience neuropathic pain from the missing part of the limb and drugs do not provide adequate relief.

Naxon,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/naxon,Active,For Profit,Private,,1-10,"Montevideo, NA - Uruguay, Uruguay",,,,,"Under the framework of Brain-Computer Interfaces, Naxon is a company that works with portable EEG technology for the development of practical tools for research purposes, innovative applications within Medicine, Clinical Psychology (Neurofeedback), Educational Psychology, Sleep and Well-being, as well as mind-controlled hardware and software technology (such us in Gaming), among other applications. BCI The major entrepreneurial leaders and experts in technology agree that the 21st century is the century of technology based on neuroscience or better known as Neurotechnology. Within this area, Brain-Computer Interfaces are positioned more and more as the new technological device that will mark a whole generation and that will be the base and the vanguard of future hardware and software ventures. A brain-computer interface is a direct communication path between an improved or connected brain and an external device. They have the potential to be used for a variety of scenarios and applications, all based on “reading the mind of the person,” for example helping individuals with physical disabilities better adapt by using a robotic hand controlled by the mind, or in video games to execute different commands using only your thoughts, or to control an external hardware, like a drone. They also have great applications in medical and psychological treatment and diagnosis among other areas. In this framework of brain-computer interfaces, our company Naxon works with portable EEG technology (a non-invasive type of brain-computer interface of recent creation) for the development of practical tools and applications. Advantages of portable EEG technology There are multiple health problems linked to the brain and neurocognitive diagnosis that must currently be evaluated through expensive equipment and/or in specialized centers. This situation limits the population’s access to diagnostic studies to treat diseases or brain disorders in time, delaying treatments that can improve the quality of life. Additionally, there are many cases of physical impairments related to brain problems that generate limitations in the normal adaptation of the person to the environment. The same technology that allows solving these difficulties and improving medical diagnosis can expand the accessibility and control of the environment of people with physical difficulties, and also in people without medical pathologies in various areas such as hardware control and the use of virtual reality. In recent years, portable low-cost electroencephalography (EEG) devices have been developed with wireless connectivity, confortable and easy to install, which can be used extensively by medical, clinical and professional centers to study certain patterns and perform diagnoses and treatments, as well as by different users for mind-controlled applications. In addition to medical centers or clinics, it can also be used in other environments such as in schools with children for performance evaluation and for support in various psychological assessments. Under the concept of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), Naxon seeks to use EEG equipment to obtain neuronal information based on brain waves, which will be recorded in  a software and data platform, which will have tools for analysis and assistance in diagnosis and treatment. We intend to lay the foundations for using big data and machine learning techniques, so that pattern analysis can be performed to improve professional assistance in diagnostics and treatment, as well as generating practical applications for different professional needs and for mind-controlled hardware and software. The platform will be available in a Software-as-a-Service format. Lines of development Currently, we have three types of products in parallel development.  On the one hand, we are developing a practical and useful tool for researchers in the fields of Neuroscience, Psychology and related areas interested in exploring the possibilities of portable EEG devices for academic and development purposes. We want research in neuroscience and psychology to be facilitated and simplified to accelerate the development of new applications that read our minds, while opening the possibility of expanding research in these disciplines in a general way by reducing the high costs of traditional EEG devices and the difficulties and restrictions that they entail to perform research in new scenarios. Thiswill allow expanding the development of new applications of brain-computer interfaces. Our product allows this, based on a software and data platform integrated with tools to configure and conduct experiments with portable EEG devices, with built-in pattern detection tools (including evoked potentials, brain wave measurements and mental state detection algorithms) and machine learning tools to work with recorded data. Each user will have the possibility to store and access the sessions on our data platform. And it will be available in a software-as-a-service format. As a second line of development, we want to take Neurotechnology applied to Clinical Psychology, Therapy or Well-being, among other areas, to another level than it currently is by developing an innovative next-generation tool. We speak of a instrument that aligns with the global advances of treatment and professional diagnosis assisted by technology, an area with a rapid incorporation in the market. Our product allows professionals to know more accurately the emotional and cognitive states of their clients and intervene on them. The product consists of a software application that can be used with a computer, cell phone or tablet that works in conjunction with portable EEG devices. Through complex patterns analysis and creation of predictive algorithms, we can differentiate different mental states, allowing a live visualization and feedback. The sessions can be recorded and accessed later, where one can display the tracking information of different mental states over time. Finally, we are working on bringing videogame control to a new level, designing commands that allow us to control them with our through thoughts and subtle movements of our face, all in a wirelessly manner. But this is not the only difference, by assessing the mental state of the person, we are able to modify the conditions of the game according to how the person is feeling, which adds one more level of immersion in the gaming experience.","Neuroscience, Software",Neurotechnology Company,2019-07-04,day,https://naxonlabs.com

More than 10 million people in the US suffer from memory loss, which can be caused by neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's and dementia), brain injuries, stroke, heart attack, or the simple aging process.  BlipIQ's intuitive interface allows users to submit and tag memories in different formats (text, image, audio, and video). The application monitors and stimulates the patient's cognitive performance, which is reported to family, physicians, and insurers in order to improve quality of life, outcomes, and to reduce costs for all parties involved. As of 2017, 11% Americans over 65 have Alzheimer's, and this number is expected to increase every year due to the aging population. This degenerative condition often results in emotional and financial strain for the patient and their beloved ones, with devastating out-of-pocket costs of up to $56 billion for families and over $200 billion to insurers per year. The average cost of a long-term care facility is approximately $48,000 per year.

IMMAD uses striped square or circle targets that are five degrees.  The stripes may appear anywhere within the central forty degrees of vision and are of varying contrast.  With marijuana use a person cannot see the stripes that are of lower contrast. The signal used in IMMAD has been demonstrated to be extremely sensitive in the detection of marijuana related driving impairment in preliminary testing.  IMMAD will be a simple two- minute objective test in a tablet or cell phone.  IMMAD uses proprietary technology to measure the sensory functional visual deficits caused by marijuana use.

Mission: To develop next-generation spinal products with a focus on innovation, scientific data, and quality in order to improve and enhance the quality of life for patients with back pain, neck pain, degenerative disc conditions, and injuries due to trauma. History: SpineCraft is a US-based, privately-held medical device company founded in 2004 by a group of medical professionals and started operations and product development in 2005. The company develops, manufactures, and markets products providing intraoperative efficiency for surgeons, cost-effectiveness for hospitals and healthcare systems, and superior outcomes for patients. Philosophy: SpineCraft creates intelligent solutions by listening to and understanding surgeons. This approach in developing implants and instruments results in more thoughtful ideas, more practical designs, and more useful devices that are extensions of the surgeon's own experience. Surgeon input remains central to the way we approach existing products or work on new ideas: from our Scientific Advisory Board to the individual surgeons who work with us on product development, we hear and see first-hand the concerns and obstacles surgeons encounter.  With strong spine product development know-how, the SpineCraft management team is distinctly qualified to apply the knowledge of what surgeons need to their own past experience and successes - developing innovative solutions that combine flexibility, functionality, cost-effectiveness, and uniqueness. Precision is at the heart of everything done at SpineCraft. From design to delivery, and every step in between, SpineCraft is committed to maintaining the highest level of quality.

With SpineCraft's efficient development process, each product beings as smart thinking from surgeons who know best what is needed in the OR. Smart products are then designed utilizing this knowledge to solve specific surgical problems in innovative ways. Each product is then manufactured to meet strict quality standards, and backed by a very responsive team of customer service and technical support professionals.","Medical, Medical Device, Neuroscience","SpineCraft develops spinal implants designed for revision surgery, deformity correction, degenerative and MIS spine procedures.",2004-01-01,year,https://www.spinecraft.com/

Through seminal studies of learning and memory in fruit flies, a key function of the CREB (cAMP Response Element Binding Protein) gene was defined for the first time. The CREB gene encodes a protein which regulates the biochemical pathway that converts short-term memory to long-term memory - and it appears to function similarly in both fruit fly and in man.

BioNimbus allows for the real time gathering and analysis of discrete data emanating from the human body in response to varied stimuli through sensors or mobile wearables. The BioNimbus technology can be applied to anything that can be sensed (e.g. sound, smell, a human interaction, etc.) and the test outcome can be appropriately designed. BioNimbus is a powerful economic disruptive force, delivering similar or better analysis to the customer faster and at costs of $300 CPI (Cost per Interview) rather than $500 to $800 CPI. Using political analysis as an example, the BioNimbus technology conducted a study in October of 2016 with faculty members of the Texas Tech the College of Media and Communications. The study investigated what genuinely causes the hard-to-move undecided voters in elections to “budge”. Budging is defined as the act of finally moving an implacable undecided definitively toward a specific candidate. The stimuli used were specific candidate inflections (eleven primary inflections). BioNimbus’ AI tools analyzed the impulse data inflections most strongly statistically correlated with “budging”. The results of the study were almost identical, in terms of voter percentage, to the national election results. The BioNimbus technology has already been applied to Consumer Packaging (“CPG”) projects. BioNimbus enables rapid testing of design concepts allowing companies to determine suitability and engagement by users and consumers at all stages of a product life cycle. It is a powerful risk management tool for a company providing insights at the stages (i.e. design, concept, prototype) when it is more economic to make product changes. A client has a great deal of control with BioNimbus with the ability to set up tests and receive analysis of data in a dashboard format. BioNimbus has applicability for a wide range of vertical markets. Aside from political analysis and CPG, other markets include education (i.e. engagement testing of content preparation), law enforcement and corrections (i.e. surveys and training of proper procedures) healthcare (i.e. labeling, protocol training) and government (i.e. armed forces training).
