Rather than just decreasing the environmental impact of conventional polystyrene foams, this invention creates a whole new paradigm where composite materials are literally grown, harnessing the incredible efficiency of nature. Shortly after founding the company, they won small grants from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA).

Evvy’s first product — the Evvy Vaginal Health Test — is the first-ever at-home vaginal microbiome test to use metagenomic sequencing to tell you what’s up down there, why it matters, and what you can do about it. Why? 30% of people with vaginas suffer from imbalances in the vaginal microbiome every year (read: bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, and recurrent UTIs). For those struggling with recurrent vaginal symptoms, Evvy’s test finally brings specificity to what is otherwise a long and difficult journey of identifying what may be related to their symptoms. What’s more — the latest research has uncovered groundbreaking links between the vaginal microbiome and infertility, STIs, preterm birth, gynecologic cancers, and more. Evvy empowers anyone with a vagina to take control of their preventative health by understanding these associations in the context of their unique microbiome. But even though the vaginal microbiome is an important marker of health, women and people with vaginas have never had access to that information about their own bodies — until today. The Evvy Vaginal Health Test is performed as a simple, at-home swab (think a Q-tip!) but provides powerful information: it can uncover all bacteria and fungi present in your vaginal microbiome. The results experience includes personalized reports and curated recommendations for improving vaginal health based on your unique microbiome. All Evvy tests also come with a free 1:1 consultation with a certified health coach who is specially trained to walk you through your results, answer questions about your microbiome, and prep you to talk to your doctor if you need.

The main inspection methods now available to growers, whether for row crops like wheat, corn or rice, or specialty crops, such as grapes, apples and flowers, are drones and human visual inspection. Yet, both have important limitations. Drones cannot see below the canopy, which is problematic for specialty crops, where the fruits, leaves, shoots, etc. must be observed directly. Human inspection,on the other hand, is not scalable, subjective and often unreliable.

Driven by science and a passion for quality, STEMCELL supports the advancement of scientific research around the world with our catalogue of more than 2000 cell biology research tools. STEMCELL Technologies was launched in 1993 when founder and CEO Allen Eaves needed a way to meet the increasing demands for his standardized, cost-effective cell culture media for growing blood-forming stem cells. At the time, Eaves was a hematologist and cancer researcher heading the Terry Fox Laboratories (TFL) and head of clinical hematology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Unsatisfied with commercially available cell culture reagents, Eaves’ research group at the TFL began making their own hematopoietic stem cell culture media using the highest quality materials they could find. Colleagues also wanted to use this media, and Eaves was able to supplement his research funds by selling culture media to other lab groups. Eventually the demand for the media from researchers around the world warranted building a designated clean room for production. The TFL did not have the funding and instead, Eaves was encouraged to purchase the business and create an independent company. Mortgaging his house and receiving a loan from Western Economic Diversification, Eaves was able to build a clean room and STEMCELL Technologies Inc. was born on July 2, 1993. STEMCELL has become the largest biotech company in Canada and continues to reinvest all profits back into developing products to better support the international research community.
